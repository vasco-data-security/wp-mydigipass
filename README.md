# wp-mydigipass


Wordpress plugin to add MYDIGIPASS.COM Secure two factor authentication to your wordpress site.

All enhancement proposals can be submitted to our github and will be considered to become part of the official code base.

The MYDIGIPASS.COM Development team.


# Installing the plugin

The easiest way is to install the plugin from within your Wordpress installation.
You can find the plugin [here](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/mydigipasscom-secure-login/). 

Or you can install the plugin manually (as usual): 

* copy the plugin folder to `$WP_HOME\wp-content\plugins` folder
* enable the plugin inside the admin console
* edit the plugin settings, especially entering the `client-id` and `client-secret`. You can get those from the [developer](http://developer.mydigipass.com) site.

Hope this helps.
